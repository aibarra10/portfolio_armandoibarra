   <h2> Unit 1: HTML</h2>
    <ol>
<li>Question 1: What do you think are the most important vocabulary terms(or key concepts) in this unit?What do you think that they mean?The most important vocabulary words in this unit are the tags such as: h1, html, !DOCTYPE, div, nav, li, and p. It means that they signify several different tags that are important for coding.</li>
<li>Question 2: What do you think are the most important skills that you learned in this unit of study? I think that the most important skills I learned are the skills I was able to understand and use for coding. Since I have a better understanding over coding and html, I now have a better understanding when it comes to computers.</li>
<li>Question 3: In what ways have you gotten better at this kind of work? I have gotten much better by becoming more efficent when it comes to coding and I know more about more tags that can help me create different kinds of links while coding. </li>
<li>Question 4: In what ways do you think you need to improve? I would say that I would have to improve on several things that I have not yet mastered, such as making tables, adding links to images, adding rows, and a div tags.</li>
<li>Question 5: What problems did you encounter while you were working on this piece? How did you solve them? During this project I encounterd many problems like adapting to using Atom, but have adapted slowly and now I have a better understanding about Atom.</li>
<li>Question 6: What was especially satisfying to you about either the process or the finished product? I was  satisfied with what I have completed so far, like  my index.html and with what Ihave learned so far about coding.</li>
<li>Question 7: If you were the teacher, what comments would you make about this piece? I would comment that HTML is well organized but there are some parts that can be improved.</li>
